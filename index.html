      <h1> Happy Birthday, Shreya 🎀💗</h1>
      <h3> 🎉 Happy 16th Birthday, Shreya! 🎉 </h3>
      <h5> Dear Shreya,
        Today is not just any ordinary day – it's a day that celebrates you, the amazing, strong, kind, hilarious, and
        endlessly beautiful soul that you are. Happy Birthday, my dearest bestie, Shreya! I honestly don’t know where to
        begin because words often fall short when I try to describe just how much you mean to me. But today, I’m going
        to
        try – not just with a simple wish, but with a message that comes straight from my heart.
        From the moment we became friends, you’ve brought so much color and light into my life. You’re the person I
        laugh
        with, cry with, share secrets with, and trust without question. You’ve been my rock during the hard times and my
        partner-in-crime during the good ones. You’ve stood by me when things were falling apart and helped me find my
        smile again. That’s rare, Shreya – that kind of friendship is something magical.
        You are the kind of best friend that people dream of having but not everyone is lucky enough to find. I don’t
        know
        what I did in life to deserve a bestie like you, but I’m endlessly grateful. You have this way of making
        everyone
        around you feel seen, heard, and loved. You never judge, you never abandon – you just show up with your whole
        heart, and that’s what makes you so special.
      </h5>
      <h2>🌟 You are strong <h2>
          <h5>Even when life tries to break you, you rise – again and again. You face challenges with bravery, and you
            inspire me with your resilience.</h5>
          <h2>💖 You are kind.</h2>
          <h5> Your heart is gold. You care deeply, love fiercely, and never hesitate to help someone in need. That
            kindness reflects in everything you do. </h5>
          <h2>😄 You are funny </h2>
          <h5> Your sense of humor could light up the darkest room. Whether it's your random jokes, silly dances, or
            funny
            stories, you always know how to make me laugh until my stomach hurts.</h5>
          <h2>🌈 You are talented</h2>
          <h5>Never doubt your abilities, Shreya. You’re creative, smart, hardworking, and full of potential. The world
            better watch out because you’re destined for great things.</h5>
          <h2>🌺 You are beautiful </h2>
          <h5>Inside and out. Not just because of your smile or style (which are both flawless, by the way!), but
            because
            of your soul. You radiate warmth and goodness.

            So today, as we celebrate your existence, I hope you take a moment to feel just how loved and cherished you
            truly are. Not just by me, but by everyone whose life you’ve touched.
          </h5>
          <h2>Some Birthday Promises from Me to You🤝🏻🤝🏻 </h2>
          <h4> 1 = I’ll always be here for you, no matter the time or place.🤝🏻</h4>
          <h4>2 = I’ll celebrate your highs and stand by you through your lows.🖐🏻🙂</h4>
          <h4>3 = I’ll make time for your rants, your dreams, and your drama.🤧</h4>
          <h4>4 = I’ll cheer you on, even when you doubt yourself.🙂</h4>
          <h4>5 = I’ll protect you, support you, and love you like a my family member.❤️🎀
          </h4>
          <h5>
            I want to fill your birthday with so much love, laughter, and joy that you carry the glow of it in your
            heart
            for the rest of the year. Eat your favorite cake (and share it with me 😜), dance like no one’s watching,
            make
            crazy memories, and just be happy – you deserve it more than anyone I know.

            And let’s not forget – birthdays aren’t just about getting older; they’re about growing, evolving, and
            embracing who you are becoming. You’re on such a beautiful journey, Shreya. Never stop believing in
            yourself.
            The world needs more people like you – kind, brave, loyal, and real.</h5>
          <h2>Let me end with a few wishes for your new year 🎀💗🤗 </h2>
          <h5> May your heart always stay full of love.

            May you always find reasons to smile, even on hard days.

            May all your dreams, big or small, start becoming realities.

            May your path be filled with opportunities, growth, and purpose.

            May your relationships be full of trust, respect, and warmth.

            And most of all, may you never forget how special you are.
          </h5>
          <h4>Here’s to you, Shreya – my sunshine on cloudy days, my biggest cheerleader, my therapist, my gossip
            partner.
          </h4>
          <h4>On this birthday and every day forward, I hope you know how much you matter, how much you're loved, and
            how
            grateful I am to call you my best friend.</h4>
          <h4>Now, go slay the day like only you can – because queens like you deserve the world. 👑</h4>
          <h4>Happy Birthday again, my bestie! 🎂🎁🎈 Let’s make this year unforgettable, together.</h4>
          <h1>Forever your bestie,
            Gopal💕</h1>
